A Dota2 game mod created as a passion project in my free time over a few years. Going from no Lua knowledge to being fairly confident in it.
I am still interested in hobbyist game development but am spending less and less time on this mod and have recently moved to unity based C# programming of games non-dependant on the Dota2 engine.
