# A Dota2 Mod written primarily in Lua over a few years
A Dota2 game mod created as a passion project in my free time over a few years. Going from no Lua knowledge to being fairly confident in it.
I am very interested in hobbyist game development but am spending less and less time on this mod and have recently moved to learning Unity in C# which has the benefit of being non-dependant on the Dota2 engine.
